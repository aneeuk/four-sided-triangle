# Four-Sided Triangle Frontend Improvement Plan

This document outlines the strategic plan for improving the Four-Sided Triangle frontend application. The plan is organized into phases, with each phase focusing on specific aspects of the application.

## Phase 1: Foundation Improvements

The first phase focuses on establishing a solid foundation for future development by addressing technical debt, improving code quality, and enhancing the developer experience.

### Goals

- Modernize the codebase by migrating to TypeScript
- Improve component structure and organization
- Enhance accessibility compliance
- Establish comprehensive testing practices

### Timeline

- Weeks 1-2: TypeScript migration for core components
- Weeks 3-4: Component restructuring and documentation
- Weeks 5-6: Accessibility improvements and testing

## Phase 2: User Experience Enhancements

The second phase focuses on improving the user experience through UI/UX improvements, performance optimizations, and new features.

### Goals

- Implement responsive design for all components
- Enhance the query interface with advanced features
- Improve loading states and error handling
- Add user preference options (dark mode, etc.)

### Timeline

- Weeks 7-8: Responsive design implementation
- Weeks 9-10: Query interface enhancements
- Weeks 11-12: Loading states and error handling improvements

## Phase 3: Advanced Features

The third phase focuses on implementing advanced features that leverage the Four-Sided Triangle's sophisticated backend capabilities.

### Goals

- Create visual selectors for domain expert models
- Implement comparison views for different model outputs
- Add visualization tools for complex data
- Enhance export and sharing capabilities

### Timeline

- Weeks 13-14: Domain expert model integration
- Weeks 15-16: Comparison and visualization tools
- Weeks 17-18: Export and sharing features

## Phase 4: Performance Optimization

The fourth phase focuses on optimizing the application's performance to ensure a smooth user experience even with complex operations.

### Goals

- Implement code splitting and lazy loading
- Add caching mechanisms for frequent queries
- Optimize rendering performance
- Implement service workers for offline capabilities

### Timeline

- Weeks 19-20: Code splitting and lazy loading
- Weeks 21-22: Caching and data management
- Weeks 23-24: Rendering optimizations and offline capabilities

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Approach

- Use feature branches for all improvements
- Require code reviews for all pull requests
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage
- Document all changes and new features

### Quality Assurance

- Automated testing for all components
- Regular accessibility audits
- Performance benchmarking
- User testing for major features

### Deployment

- Use staging environment for pre-release testing
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollout
- Monitor performance and error rates after deployment
- Collect user feedback for continuous improvement

## Success Metrics

- 95% or higher TypeScript coverage
- 90% or higher test coverage for critical paths
- WCAG AA compliance for all components
- 20% improvement in core web vitals
- Positive user feedback on new features
