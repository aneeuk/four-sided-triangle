# Semantic ATDB Stage (Stage 1)

The Semantic ATDB (Adversarial Throttle Detection and Bypass) stage handles semantic analysis of user queries with advanced mechanisms to detect and overcome LLM throttling.

## Components

### semantic_atdb_service.py
The main service orchestrating the semantic analysis pipeline with throttle detection and bypass. Key functionality includes:
- Coordinating the processing flow through multiple phases
- Initiating semantic analysis of queries
- Managing throttle detection and bypass strategies
- Reconciling and merging analysis results
- Recording metrics and performance data

### throttle_detector.py
Detects when language models are attempting to throttle or limit responses. Features include:
- Pattern recognition for identifying throttling behavior
- Confidence assessment for detection accuracy
- Multiple detection strategies for different throttling techniques
- Analysis of response content, structure, and patterns

### bypass_strategies.py
Implements strategies to bypass throttling when detected. Key strategies include:
- Query partitioning: Breaking queries into smaller, focused components
- Depth reframing: Restructuring queries to avoid triggering limitations
- Progressive disclosure: Gradually expanding query scope through multiple interactions
- Strategy selection based on throttling patterns and query characteristics

### prompt_generator.py
Creates optimized prompts for semantic analysis and bypass strategies. Functionality includes:
- Generating base semantic analysis prompts
- Customizing prompts for specific bypass strategies
- Incorporating context and focus instructions
- Optimizing prompt structure for maximum information extraction

### metrics.py
Analyzes and records performance metrics for the semantic analysis process. Features include:
- Tracking throttling detection rates and patterns
- Measuring bypass strategy effectiveness
- Recording response quality and completeness
- Performance monitoring for optimization

## Process Flow

1. Initial semantic analysis is performed on the user query
2. Throttle detection determines if the response is limited
3. If throttling is detected, an appropriate bypass strategy is selected
4. The bypass strategy is executed to obtain enhanced analyses
5. Results from initial and enhanced analyses are reconciled
6. The final comprehensive semantic model is returned with metadata

This stage is critical for ensuring complete and unbiased information extraction, particularly in cases where language models might apply internal limitations on certain types of information.
