# Reasoning Optimization Stage (Stage 3)

The Reasoning Optimization stage applies advanced reasoning strategies, optimizes solution approaches, and reduces cognitive biases in the query processing pipeline.

## Components

### reasoning_optimization_service.py
The main service orchestrating the reasoning optimization process. Key functionality includes:
- Managing the reasoning strategy selection
- Applying optimization techniques to solve complex problems
- Reducing cognitive biases in reasoning paths
- Evaluating solution quality and computational efficiency
- Recording performance metrics and optimization decisions

### strategy_selector.py
Selects appropriate reasoning strategies based on problem characteristics. Features include:
- Problem classification and feature extraction
- Strategy matching based on problem type
- Confidence scoring for strategy selection
- Multi-strategy composition for complex problems
- Adaptive learning from previous strategy performance

### optimization_techniques.py
Implements a variety of optimization approaches. Key techniques include:
- Mathematical optimization (linear programming, constraint satisfaction)
- Heuristic optimization (genetic algorithms, simulated annealing)
- Numerical methods (gradient descent, Newton's method)
- Reinforcement learning for sequential decision making
- Selection based on problem characteristics and complexity

### bias_reduction.py
Implements methods to identify and mitigate cognitive biases. Features include:
- Bias detection in reasoning patterns
- Counterfactual reasoning generation
- Perspective diversification
- Confirmation bias mitigation
- Probabilistic reasoning enhancement

### solution_evaluator.py
Evaluates the quality and efficiency of generated solutions. Functionality includes:
- Solution validity checking
- Performance assessment against benchmarks
- Computational complexity analysis
- Trade-off analysis (time vs. quality)
- Feedback generation for refinement

## Process Flow

1. The stage receives processed query data from upstream stages
2. Problem characteristics are analyzed to select appropriate reasoning strategies
3. Optimization techniques are applied to develop solution approaches
4. Bias reduction methods are applied to improve reasoning quality
5. Solutions are evaluated for quality, efficiency, and bias
6. The optimized reasoning model is returned with performance metadata

## Integration with Pipeline

The Reasoning Optimization stage builds upon:
- Query analysis from Stage 0 (Query Processor)
- Semantic models from Stage 1 (Semantic ATDB)
- Domain knowledge from Stage 2 (Domain Knowledge)

It provides optimized reasoning approaches to:
- Stage 4 (Solution Generation) for implementing concrete solutions
- Stage 5 (Response Scoring) for evaluating solution quality
- Stage 6 (Response Comparison) for final solution selection

This stage is particularly critical for optimization problems, complex reasoning tasks, and scenarios where cognitive biases might impact solution quality.
