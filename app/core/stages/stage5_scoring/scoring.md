# Response Scoring Stage (Stage 5)

## Overview

The Response Scoring stage evaluates the quality of generated solutions using a Bayesian evaluation framework. This stage assesses multiple quality dimensions, quantifies uncertainty in the assessment, and determines whether refinement is needed.

## Components

### 1. ResponseScoringService

**Purpose**: Orchestrates the entire response scoring process by coordinating the Bayesian evaluator, quality dimension assessor, uncertainty quantifier, and refinement analyzer.

**Key Functions**:

- `process(prompt, context)`: Processes and evaluates the quality of a generated solution, returning a comprehensive assessment.
- `refine(refinement_prompt, context, previous_output)`: Re-evaluates a solution after refinement, providing comparative metrics on improvement.
- `_calculate_overall_score(quality_scores)`: Calculates the weighted overall quality score based on dimension weights.

### 2. BayesianEvaluator

**Purpose**: Implements a Bayesian framework for evaluating response quality by calculating posterior probabilities, likelihoods, and priors.

**Key Functions**:

- `evaluate(solution, domain_knowledge, query_intent)`: Evaluates the solution using Bayesian probability framework.
- `_calculate_prior_probability(solution, query_intent)`: Calculates P(R|Q) - prior probability of response given query.
- `_calculate_likelihood(solution, domain_knowledge, query_intent)`: Calculates P(D|R,Q) - likelihood of domain knowledge given response and query.
- `_calculate_evidence_factor(domain_knowledge, query_intent)`: Calculates P(D|Q) - evidence factor for normalization.
- `_calculate_information_gain(solution, domain_knowledge, query_intent)`: Measures information added beyond domain knowledge.
- `_calculate_mutual_information(solution, domain_knowledge, query_intent)`: Measures alignment between solution and query intent.

### 3. QualityDimensionAssessor

**Purpose**: Assesses multiple quality dimensions of generated solutions including accuracy, completeness, consistency, relevance, and novelty.

**Key Functions**:

- `assess_dimensions(solution, domain_knowledge, query_intent, bayesian_metrics)`: Assesses solution across all quality dimensions.
- `_assess_accuracy(solution, domain_knowledge, bayesian_metrics)`: Evaluates factual correctness relative to domain knowledge.
- `_assess_completeness(solution, domain_knowledge, query_intent)`: Measures coverage of required information.
- `_assess_consistency(solution)`: Analyzes internal logical coherence and structure.
- `_assess_relevance(solution, query_intent, bayesian_metrics)`: Measures alignment with user's query intent.
- `_assess_novelty(solution, domain_knowledge)`: Evaluates presence of non-obvious insights.
- `_fact_similarity(fact1, fact2)`: Calculates similarity between factual statements.
- `_formula_similarity(formula1, formula2)`: Calculates similarity between mathematical formulas.

### 4. UncertaintyQuantifier

**Purpose**: Quantifies uncertainty in quality assessment, providing confidence bounds and variance estimates for quality scores.

**Key Functions**:

- `quantify(solution, quality_scores, bayesian_metrics)`: Quantifies uncertainty in all quality dimensions.
- `_quantify_dimension_uncertainty(dimension, score, solution, bayesian_metrics)`: Calculates uncertainty for a specific quality dimension.
- `_calculate_confidence_margin(variance)`: Determines confidence interval margins based on variance.
- `_calculate_overall_confidence(posterior_probability)`: Calculates overall confidence from Bayesian posterior.
- `_estimate_solution_complexity(solution)`: Estimates complexity factor that affects uncertainty.
- `_estimate_evidence_strength(dimension, solution, bayesian_metrics)`: Estimates evidence strength for each dimension.
- `_calculate_average_interval(uncertainty_metrics)`: Calculates average width of confidence intervals.
- `_find_highest_uncertainty(uncertainty_metrics)`: Identifies dimension with highest uncertainty.

### 5. RefinementAnalyzer

**Purpose**: Analyzes quality scores and uncertainty metrics to determine if refinement is needed and prioritize improvement areas.

**Key Functions**:

- `analyze(quality_scores, uncertainty_metrics, threshold)`: Analyzes scores to determine refinement needs.
- `_analyze_dimensions(quality_scores, uncertainty_metrics)`: Analyzes each dimension against its threshold.
- `_calculate_weighted_score(quality_scores)`: Calculates weighted quality score across dimensions.
- `_prioritize_refinement(dimension_analysis, quality_scores, uncertainty_metrics)`: Prioritizes dimensions for refinement.
- `_generate_suggestions(dimension_analysis, refinement_priority, quality_scores)`: Generates specific refinement suggestions.

## Workflow

1. **Input Processing**:
   - The ResponseScoringService receives the generated solution, domain knowledge, and query intent from the context.

2. **Bayesian Evaluation**:
   - The BayesianEvaluator calculates posterior probability P(R|D,Q), likelihood P(D|R,Q), prior P(R|Q), and evidence factor P(D|Q).
   - Additional information metrics like mutual information and information gain are computed.

3. **Quality Dimension Assessment**:
   - The QualityDimensionAssessor evaluates the solution across five key dimensions:
     - Accuracy: Factual correctness relative to domain knowledge
     - Completeness: Coverage of required information elements
     - Consistency: Internal logical coherence of the solution
     - Relevance: Alignment with the user's query intent
     - Novelty: Presence of non-obvious insights or connections

4. **Uncertainty Quantification**:
   - The UncertaintyQuantifier calculates confidence bounds and variance estimates for each quality score.
   - It determines confidence levels based on solution complexity and evidence strength.
   - It identifies dimensions with highest uncertainty for potential focus in refinement.

5. **Refinement Analysis**:
   - The RefinementAnalyzer determines if the solution needs refinement based on quality thresholds.
   - It prioritizes dimensions for refinement based on impact and feasibility.
   - It generates specific refinement suggestions with severity levels and expected improvement.

6. **Output Generation**:
   - The service combines all assessments into a comprehensive quality evaluation.
   - The output includes Bayesian metrics, quality scores, uncertainty metrics, and refinement recommendations.
   - An overall score and refinement decision are provided.

7. **Refinement Process** (if needed):
   - If refinement is needed, the stage suggests specific improvements.
   - After refinement, the solution can be re-evaluated to measure improvement.

## Usage Example

The Response Scoring stage is typically invoked after the Solution Generation stage (Stage 4) in the pipeline:

```python
# Extract the generated solution from previous stage
solution = context.get("stage_outputs", {}).get("solution_generation", {})

# Perform quality assessment
assessment = response_scoring_service.process(prompt, context)

# Check if refinement is needed
if assessment["needs_refinement"]:
    refinement_suggestions = assessment["refinement_suggestions"]
    # Forward to refinement process...
else:
    # Proceed to next stage
    pass
```

## Configuration Parameters

The Response Scoring stage can be configured with the following parameters:

- **dimension_weights**: Weights for each quality dimension in overall score calculation
- **refinement_threshold**: Threshold for determining if refinement is needed
- **bayesian_evaluator**: Configuration for Bayesian evaluation components
- **quality_dimension_assessor**: Configuration for quality dimension assessment
- **uncertainty_quantifier**: Configuration for uncertainty quantification
- **refinement_analyzer**: Configuration for refinement analysis

## Integration with Orchestrator

The Response Scoring stage implements the AbstractPipelineStage interface to seamlessly integrate with the metacognitive orchestrator:

- It exposes a standard process() method for evaluation
- It supports a refine() method for re-evaluation after refinement
- It maintains metrics about its processing for monitoring
- It has a unique stage_id of "response_scoring"
