# Domain Knowledge Extraction Stage (Stage 2)

The Domain Knowledge Extraction stage retrieves specialized domain knowledge from expert language models and other sources, prioritizes it by relevance, and establishes confidence levels for each knowledge element.

## Components

### domain_knowledge_service.py
The main service orchestrating the domain knowledge extraction process. Key functionality includes:
- Coordinating the extraction pipeline flow
- Managing access to domain-specific LLMs
- Prioritizing knowledge by relevance to the query
- Establishing knowledge confidence levels
- Structuring the extracted knowledge for downstream stages

### knowledge_extractor.py
Core component responsible for extracting domain-specific knowledge. Features include:
- Specialized extraction techniques for different domains
- Access to domain-specific knowledge bases
- Identification of formulas, constraints, and relationships
- Hierarchical knowledge representation
- Reference value extraction for specified parameters

### knowledge_prioritizer.py
Prioritizes and ranks extracted knowledge elements. Functionality includes:
- Relevance scoring for each knowledge element
- Dependency mapping between knowledge components
- Confidence level assessment for each element
- Uncertainty quantification across the knowledge set
- Priority weighting based on query requirements

### llm_connector.py
Manages connections to domain-expert language models. Features include:
- Integration with Sprint-LLM domain expert models
- Specialized prompt construction for knowledge extraction
- Response parsing and structured representation
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Performance optimization for model interactions

### knowledge_validator.py
Validates and verifies extracted knowledge. Functionality includes:
- Consistency checking across knowledge elements
- Identification of contradictions or conflicts
- Source reliability assessment
- Cross-validation with multiple sources when available
- Documentation of limitations and caveats

## Process Flow

1. The semantic representation from the previous stage is analyzed to determine required domains
2. Domain-specific expert LLMs are selected based on query needs
3. Specialized prompts are constructed to extract relevant knowledge
4. Knowledge extraction is performed across all required domains
5. Extracted knowledge is validated and prioritized based on relevance
6. Confidence levels and uncertainty metrics are established for each knowledge element
7. Knowledge elements are structured with their relationships and dependencies
8. The comprehensive domain knowledge model is returned with metadata

This stage is critical for providing accurate, specialized knowledge that serves as the foundation for subsequent reasoning and solution generation stages. It ensures that all domain-specific constraints, formulas, and relationships are properly captured and represented with appropriate confidence levels.
