# Interpreter Component

The interpreter directory contains the services and modules responsible for transforming raw computational results into user-friendly explanations and insights.

## Files

### interpreter_service.py
The main service orchestrating the interpretation pipeline:
- Initializes LLM clients for response translation and quality assessment
- Coordinates the interpretation flow through multiple processing stages
- Extracts key insights from computational results
- Generates technical and user-friendly explanations
- Assesses response quality
- Provides fallback mechanisms

Key methods:
- `interpret_solution()`: Transforms a solution package into user-friendly content
- `_generate_technical_explanation()`: Creates technical documentation of results
- `_extract_key_insights()`: Identifies the most important findings
- `_generate_follow_up_suggestions()`: Creates contextual follow-up questions

### response_translator.py
Handles translation of technical content to appropriate user levels:
- Converts technical explanations to user-friendly language
- Adapts content based on user expertise level
- Enhances explanations with domain-specific context
- Optimizes readability and comprehension

### quality_assessor.py
Evaluates the quality of generated interpretations:
- Assesses accuracy of technical content
- Evaluates clarity and readability
- Checks completeness of information
- Verifies domain-specific correctness
- Provides quality metrics for monitoring

### models.py
Contains Pydantic models for the interpreter component:
- `InterpretationRequest`: Model for interpretation requests
- `InterpretationResponse`: Model for interpretation responses
- `InterpretedSolution`: Model for fully processed solutions
- `ResponseQualityMetrics`: Model for quality assessment metrics

### router.py
Implements the FastAPI router for interpreter endpoints:
- `POST /api/interpreter/interpret`: Process interpretation requests
- `POST /api/interpreter/quality-check`: Assess interpretation quality
- Additional utility endpoints for component testing

## Process Flow

1. The interpreter receives a solution package from the solver
2. A technical explanation is generated from the solution
3. Key insights are extracted from conclusions and results
4. A user-friendly explanation is created based on user context
5. Follow-up suggestions are generated
6. Quality metrics are calculated for the interpretation
7. The complete interpreted solution is returned

The interpreter component serves as the critical bridge between mathematical/computational results and human understanding, ensuring that complex findings are presented in a clear, accurate, and contextually appropriate manner.
